# WeatherBee App

### A backend developer's attempt to create a basic weather app
#### This weather app was created by going reading swift textbooks, following online tutorials, going through writups and platform documentations

**Currently**

- Fetches location, and determines weather information for the area
- Tabulates them into a simple view
- Weather parameters include Min Temp, MaxTemp, Humidity, Wind Speed e.t.c
- Also fetches Air quality information
- Tabulates parameters like CO, NO, PM10, PM25 e.t.c into a simple view


**Future fixes to be attempted**

- Looping Animations as app backgrounds depicting an area's current weather
- Lesser location load times
- Support for all orientations (only portrait and upside down)
- Support for all devices (currenly only limited to current generation devices)
